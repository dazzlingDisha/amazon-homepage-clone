# Amazon Homepage Clone 🛒

This is a fully responsive clone of Amazon's homepage built using only **HTML and CSS**, inspired by Apna College's YouTube tutorial. While the tutorial covered just a few components, I challenged myself to go further and recreated the some more elements.

## 🔥 Features

- Full top navigation bar with search, language selector, and cart icon
- Multiple **product showcase sections** with styled image grids
- Eye-catching **hero section** with a promotional banner
- Structured **multi-column footer**, similar to Amazon's layout
- Hover effects, structured layout, and clean design
- Font Awesome icons integrated via CDN

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3 (with Flexbox)
- Font Awesome (via CDN)
- Responsive design techniques
- Hosted & local image assets

## 🎯 What I Learned

- Creating large-scale layouts with only HTML and CSS
- Mastering Flexbox for complex positioning
- Organizing styles cleanly for scalable design
- Building real-world UI replicas from scratch

## 💡 Live Demo

🚀 Coming soon on GitHub Pages
